# Dream-Vault - Setup and Run Instructions

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository from GitHub. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RanbirSDeol/dream-vault
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd dream-vault
```

## Step 3: Create Necessary Directories

Make sure you are inside the /dream-vault directory when doing this. You
can also choose to change the location of journal if you wish, but you must
go into dream-vault/src/journal.py and edit the directories path.

Also add a sync.txt (optional: if you want to use the sync command), and add
the logs.txt file (required).

```bash
mkdir backups
mkdir journal
touch sync.txt
touch logs.txt
```

## Step 4: Execute Program

Navigate to the source folder, and execute the program
(You can either use python3 or python, depending on your system configuration.)

```bash
cd src
python3 journal.py
```

## Step 5: Use 'help' Command To Navigate

To figure out how to use the program, you may want to use the 'help' command,
it will help you understand what commands you can call, the rest is self explanatory.

```bash
Dream Journal Assistance

Enter a command (type 'help' for commands): help
```
